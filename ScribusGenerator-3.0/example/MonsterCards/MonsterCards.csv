1,Cave Dweller,Ankheg,"A hide like plate armor and great crushing mandibles are problematic. A stomach full of acid that can burn a hole through a stone wall makes them all the worse. They'd be bad enough if they were proper insect-sized, but these things have the gall to be as long as any given horse. It's just not natural! Good thing they tend to stick to one place? Easy for you to say-you don't have an ankheg living under your corn field. ",10,3,d8+1,Bite (Close Reach),Burrowing ,"Group, Large",423,10,9.5,Chocolate,2
2,Cave Dweller,Cave Rat,"Who hasn't seen a rat before? It's like that, but nasty and big and not afraid of you anymore. Maybe this one was a cousin to that one you caught in a trap or the one you killed with a knife in that filthy tavern in Darrow. Maybe he's looking for a little ratty revenge.",7,1,d6 piercing 1,Gnaw (Close Messy),,"Horde, Small",270,12,11.5,Chocolate,2
20,Denizens of the Swamp,Bakunawa,"Dragon-Turtle's sister is a mighty serpent queen. Ten yards of scales and muscle, they say she wakes with a hunger when the sun disappears from the sky. She is attracted by bright light in the darkness and like any snake, the Bakunawa is sneaky. She will seek first to beguile and mislead and will only strike out with violence when no other option is available. When she does, though, her jaws are strong enough to crack the hull of any swamp-boat and certainly enough to slice through a steel breastplate or two. Give the greedy snake your treasures and she might just leave you alone.",16,2,d10+3 piercing 1,Bite (Close Reach),Amphibious ,"Solitary, Large, Intelligent, Messy, Forceful",587,9,8.5,Butter,3

Sorry, I know you're looking for something helpful, sirs. Serious stuff, I understand. The basilisk, even without its ability to turn your flesh to stone with a gaze, is a dangerous creature. A bit like a frog, bulbous eyes and six muscled legs built for leaping. A bit like an alligator, with snapping jaws and sawing teeth. Covered in stony scales and very hard to kill. Best avoided, if possible.''",12,2,d10,Bite (Close),,"Solitary, Hoarder",517,9,8.5,Butter,3
41,Folk of the Realm,Adventurer,"''Scum of the earth, they are. A troupe of armored men and women come sauntering into town, brandishing what, for all intents and purposes, is enough magical and mundane power to level the whole place. Bringing with them bags and bags of loot, still dripping blood from whatever poor sod they had to kill to get it. An economical fiasco waiting to happen, if you ask me. The whole system becomes completely uprooted. Dangerous, unpredictable murder-hobos. Oh, wait, you're an adventurer? I take it all back.''",3,1,d6,Sword (Close),Endless enthusiasm ,"Horde, Intelligent",509,9,8.5,Orange,4

Highway robbery, poaching, scams and cons and murder most foul but we've all got to eat so who can blame them? Then again, there's evil in the hearts of some and who's to say that desperation isn't a need to sate one's baser lusts?

58,Legions of the Undead,Abomination,Corpses sewn onto corpses make up the bulk of these shambling masses of dark magic. Most undead are crafted to be controlled-made to serve some purpose like building a tower or serving as guardians. Not so the abomination. The last aspect of the ritual used to grant fire to their hellish limbs invokes a hatred so severe that the abomination knows but one task: to tear and rend at the very thing it cannot have-life. Many students of the black arts learn to their mortal dismay the most important fact about these hulks; an abomination knows no master.,20,1,d10+3,Slam (Close Reach Forceful),"Many limbs, heads, and so on ","Solitary, Large, Construct, Terrifying",554,9,8.5,Scarlet Red,5
59,Legions of the Undead,Banshee,"Come away from an encounter with one of these vengeful spirits merely deaf and count yourself lucky for the rest of your peaceful, silent days. Often mistaken at first glance for a ghost or wandering spirit, the banshee reveals a far more deadly talent for sonic assault when angered. And her anger comes easy. A victim of betrayal (often by a loved one) the banshee makes known her displeasure with a roar or scream that can putrefy flesh and rend the senses. If you can help her get her vengeance, they say she might grant rewards. Whether the affection of a spurned spirit is a thing you'd want, well, that's another question.",16,0,d10,Scream (Near),Insubstantial ,"Solitary, Magical, Intelligent",629,8,7.5,Scarlet Red,5

Avra'hal wept and wept and did agree to do this and did take up her sword and tome and did into the villages go, a great thirst for blood on her lips for the word the angel wrote upon the soul of Avra'hal was ?kill'.''",18,4,b2d10+4 ignores armor,Sword of Flames (Close Forceful),Wings ,"Solitary, Terrifying, Divine, Intelligent, Organized",607,9,8.5,Plum,6
80,Planar Powers,Barbed Devil,"There are a thousand forms of devil, maybe more. Some common and some unique. Each time the Inquisitors discover a new one they write it into the Tormentors Codex and the knowledge is shared among the abbeys in the hope that atrocities of that particular sort won't find their way into the world again. The barbed devil has long been known to the brothers and sisters of the Inquisition. It appears only at a site of great violence or when called by a wayward summoner. Covered in sharp quills, this particular demon revels in the spilling of blood, preferably by impaling victims piecemeal or in whole upon its thorns and letting them die there. Cruel but not particularly effective beyond slaughter. A low inquisitorial priority.",16,3,d10+3 piercing 3,Spines (Close Reach Messy),Spines ,"Solitary, Large, Planar, Terrifying",731,8,7.5,Plum,6
90,Ravenous Hordes,Formian Centurion,"Whether in the form of a legionnaire, part of the formian standing army, or as a praetorian guard to the queen, every formian hive contains a great number of these most dangerous insectoids. Darker in carapace, often scarred with furrows and the ceremonial markings that set them apart from their drones, the formian centurions are their fighting force and rightly so. Born, bred and living for the singular purpose of killing the enemies of their hive, they fight with one mind and a hundred swords. Thus far, the powers of Law have seen fit to spare mankind a great war with these creatures, but we've seen them in skirmish-descending sometimes on border towns with their wings flickering in the heat or spilling up from a sandy mound to wipe clean a newly-dug mine. Theirs is an orderly bloodshed, committed with no pleasure but the completion of a goal.",7,3,b2d6+2,Barbed Spear (Close Reach),"Hive connection, Insectoid, Wings ","Horde, Intelligent, Organized",857,7,6.5,Sky Blue,7
91,Ravenous Hordes,Formian Drone,"With good cause, they say that these creatures (like all insects, really) are claimed by the powers of Law. They are order made flesh-a perfectly stratified society in which every larva, hatchling and adult knows its place in the great hive. The formian is some strange intersection of men and ants. (Though there are winged tribes that look like wasps out in the Western Desert, I've heard. And some with great sawtooth arms like mantids in the forests of the east.) Tall, with a hard shell and a harder mind, these particular formians are the bottom caste.

109,The Dark Woods,Assassin Vine,"Among the animals there exists a clear division ?tween hunter and hunted. All it takes is a glance to know-by fangs and glowing eyes or claws or venomous sting-which of the creatures of this world are meant to kill and which stand to be killed. Such a split, if you have the eyes to see it, cuts the world of leaves and flowers in twain, as well. Druids in their forest circles know it. Rangers, too, might spot such a plant before it's too late. Lay folk, though, they wander where they oughtn't-paths into the deep woods covered in creeping vines and with a snap, these hungry ropes snap tight, dragging their meaty prey into the underbrush.

110,The Dark Woods,Blink Dog,"Now you see it, now you don't. Hounds once owned by a sorcerer lord and imbued with a kind of illusory cloak, they escaped into the woods around his lair and began to breed with wolves and wild dogs of the forest. You can spot them, if you're lucky, by the glittering silver of their coats and their strange, ululating howls. They have a remarkable talent for being not quite where they appear to be and use it to take down prey much stronger than themselves. If you find yourself facing a pack of blink dogs you might as well close your eyes and fight. You'll have an easier time when not betrayed by your natural sight.

Fish the size of whales, with strange growths of gelatinous feelers used to probe the lightless shores. They're served by slaves: blind albino victims of any race unfortunate enough to stumble on them, drained of thought and life by the powers of the aboleth's alien mind. In the depths they plot against each other, fishy cultists building and digging upward towards the surface until someday, they'll breach it.

It shall come upon the plains and mountains not from beyond this world but from within it. Birthed from the womb of deepest earth shall come the Dragon that Will End the World. In its passing all will become ash and bile and the Dungeon World a dying thing will drift through planar space devoid of life. They say to worship the Apocalypse Dragon is to invite madness.

140,Twisted Experiment,Bulette,"A seasoned caravan guard learns to listen for the calls of a scout or sentry with a keen ear. A few extra seconds after the alarm is raised can mean life or death. Different cries mean different responses, too-a call of ''orcs!'' means draw your sword and steady for blood but a call of ''bandits!'' says you might be able to bargain. One alarm from the scouts that always, always means it's time to pack up, whip your horse and run for the hills?

141,Twisted Experiment,Chimera,"Well-known and categorized, the chimera is a perfected creature. From the codices of the Mage's Guild to the famous pages of Cullaina's Creature Compendium, there's no confusion about what chimera means. Two parts lioness, one part serpent, head of a she-goat, and all the vicious magic one can muster. The actual ritual might vary, as might a detail or two-more creative sorcerers switch the flame breath for acid, perhaps. Used as a guardian, an assassin or merely an instrument of chaos unchained, it matters little.

3,Cave Dweller,Choker,"Some say these things descended from the family of a cruel wizard who forced them to live out their lives underground. They say his experiments led him to fear the sun and ages passed while he descended into unlife, dragging his folk along with him. These things resemble men, in a way. Head, four limbs and all that. Only their skin is wet and rubbery and their arms long and fingers grasping. They hate all life that bears the stink of the sun's touch, as one might expect.

60,Legions of the Undead,Devourer,"Most folk know that the undead feed on flesh. The warmth, blood and living tissue continue their unholy existence. This is true for most of the mindless dead, animated by black sorcery. Not so the devourer. When a particularly wicked person (often a manipulator of men, an apostate priest or the like) dies in a gruesome way, the dark powers of Dungeon World might bring them back to a kind of life. The devourer, however, does not feed on the flesh of men or elves. The devourer eats souls. It kills with a pleasure only the sentient can enjoy and in the moments of its victims' expiry, draws breath like a drowning man and swallows a soul. What does it mean to have your soul eaten by such a creature? None dare ask for fear of finding out.",16,1,d10+3,Smash (Close Reach Forceful),,"Solitary, Large, Intelligent, Hoarder",742,8,7.5,Scarlet Red,
81,Planar Powers,Chain Devil,"Do you think the phrase ''drag him to hell'' means nothing? It is unfortunately literal, in the case of the chain devil. Appearing differently to each victim, this summoned creature has but a single purpose: to wrap its victim up in binding coils and take it away to a place of torment. Sometimes it will come as a man-shaped mass of rusting iron, hooks and coils of mismatched links. Other times, a roiling tangle of rope or kelp or twisted bloody bedsheets. The results are always the same.",12,3,d10 ignores armor,Crush (Close Reach),,"Solitary, Planar",492,10,9.5,Plum,
92,Ravenous Hordes,Formian Queen,"At the heart of every hive, no matter its size or kind, lives a queen. As large as any giant, she sits protected by her guard, served by every drone and taskmaster with her own, singular purpose: to spread her kind and grow the hive. To birth the eggs. To nurture. We do not understand the minds of these creatures but it is known they can communicate with their children, somehow, over vast distances and that they begin to teach them the ways of earth and stone and war while still pale and wriggling larvae, without a word.

142,Twisted Experiment,Derro,"It's typical to think that all the malignant arcane monsters made in this world are birthed by wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk. That the colleges and towers of Dungeon World are womb to every bleak experiment. There are mistakes made in the depths of the earth, too. These ones, the derro, are the mistakes of a long-forgotten dwarven alchemist. The derro don't forget, though. Twisted and hateful, the derro can be spotted by their swollen skulls, brain-matter grown too large.

Stout bearded battle-hungry dwarves who would push them, time and time again, back up out of their mines and tunnels with ferocity. It just goes to show how little men know about the elder races. These folk are merely a vanguard, and they bravely do their duty to protect the riches of the Dwarven realm. Earn their trust and you've an ally for life.

The fire in their belly isn't just metaphorical, no. Watch as I goad the beast. Aha! A spout of flame! Unexpected, isn't it?

Oh gods, I think it's coming ''",16,1,d10+1,Axe (Close Reach),Unerring sense of direction ,"Solitary, Large",300,11,10.5,Rose,
138,The Lower Depths,Naga,"Ambitious and territorial above nearly all else, the naga are very rarely found without a well-formed and insidious cult of followers. You'll see it in many mountain towns-a snake sigil scrawled on a tavern wall or a local church burned to the ground. People going missing in the mines. Men and women wearing the mark of the serpent. At the core of it all lies a naga: an old race now fallen into obscurity, still preening with the head of a man over its coiled, serpent body. Variations of these creatures exist depending on their bloodline and original purpose, but they are all master manipulators and magical forces to be reckoned with.",12,2,d10,Bite (Close Reach),,"Solitary, Intelligent, Organized, Hoarder, Magical",640,8,7.5,Rose,
139,The Lower Depths,Salamander,"''The excavation uncovered what the reports called a basalt gate. Black stone carved with molten runes. When they dug it up, the magi declared it inert but further evidence indicates that was an incorrect claim. The entire team went missing. When we arrived, the gate was glowing. Its light filled the whole cavern. We could see from the entrance that the area had become full of these creatures-like men with red and orange skin, tall as an ogre but with a snake's tail where their legs ought to be. They were clothed, too-some had black glass armor. They spoke to each other in a tongue that sounded like grease in a fire. I wanted to leave but the sergeant wouldn't listen. You've already read what happened next, sir. I know I'm the only one that got back, but what I said is true. The gate is open, now. This is just the beginning!''",7,3,b2d6+3,Flaming Spear (Close Reach Near),Burrowing ,"Horde, Large, Intelligent, Organized, Planar",838,7,6.5,Rose,
143,Twisted Experiment,Digester,"It's okay, magical experimentation is a messy science. For every beautiful pegasus there's a half-done creature that wasn't quite right. We understand. The goblin-elephant you thought was such a great idea. The Gelatinous Drake. Just examples. No judgement here. Anyway, we've got something for that. We call it the Digester. Yes, just like it sounds. Strange looking, I know, and the smell isn't the best, but this thing-it'll eat magic like Svenloff the Stout drinks ale. Next time one of these unfortunate accidents occurs, just point the Digester at it and all your troubles drain away. Just keep an eye on it. Damn thing ate my wand last week.",16,1,d10+1 ignores armor,Acid (Close Reach),Digest acid secretion ,"Solitary, Large, Construct",648,8,7.5,Green,
144,Twisted Experiment,Ethereal Filcher,"Things go missing. A sock, a silver spoon, your dead mother's bones. We blame the maid, or bad luck, or just a moment of stupid forgetfulness and we move on. We never get to see the real cause of these problems. The spidery thing with human hands and eyes as blue as the deep Ethereal plane from whence the creature comes. We never see the nest it makes of astral silver webbing and stolen objects arranged in some mad pattern. We never watch it assemble its collection of halfling finger-bones, stolen from the hands of the sleeping. We're lucky, that way.",12,1,w2d8,Stolen Dagger (Close Reach),Burrowing ,"Solitary, Devious, Planar",557,9,8.5,Green,

146,Twisted Experiment,Flesh Golem,"Stolen bits and pieces in the night. Graveyards stealthily uprooted and maybe tonight an arm, a leg, another head (the last one came apart too soon). Even the humblest hedge-enchanter can make do with what he can and, with a little creativity, well-it's not only the college that can make life, hmm? We'll show them.",3,0,d6+2,Miscellaneous Claws and Teeth (Close Forceful),Many body parts ,Horde,316,11,10.5,Green,
147,Twisted Experiment,Girallon,"The pounding of the jungle drums calls to it. The slab of meat on the sacrificial stone to lure in the great ape. Girallon, they call it-a name from the long-forgotten tongue of the kings who bred the beast. Taller than a building, some say. Cloaked in ivory fur with tusks as long as scimitars. Four arms? Six? The rumors are hard to verify. Every year it is the same: some explorer visits the jungle villages seeking the ape and returns, never quite the same, never with a trophy. The pounding of the drums goes on.",20,1,d10+5,Rending Hands (Reach Forceful),Many arms ,"Solitary, Huge",517,9,8.5,Green,
148,Twisted Experiment,Iron Golem,"A staple of the enchanter's art. Every golemist and mechano-thaumaturge in the kingdoms knows this. Iron is a misnomer, though. These guardians are crafted of any metal, really: steel, copper, or even gold, in some small cases. As much an art as a science, the crafting of a fine golem is as respected in the Kingdoms as a bridge newly built or a castle erected in the mountains. Unceasing watchdog, stalwart defender, the iron golem lives to serve, following its orders eternally. Any enchanter worth his salt can craft one, if he can afford the materials.

149,Twisted Experiment,Kraken,"''A cephalo-what? No, boy. Not ''a kraken'' but ''the kraken.'' I don't know what nonsense they taught you at that school you say you're from, but here, we know to respect the Hungerer. Right, that's what we call it, The Hungerer in the Deep to be more proper. Ain't no god, though we've got those, too. It's a squid! A mighty squid with tentacles thicker ?round than a barrel and eyes the size of the full moon. Smart, too, the Hungerer. Knows just when to strike-when you're all too drunk or too tired or run out of clean water, that's when he gets you. No, I ain't ever seen him. I'm alive, aren't I?''",20,2,d10+5,Giant Tentacles (Reach Forceful),Aquatic ,"Solitary, Huge",605,9,8.5,Green,
150,Twisted Experiment,Manticore,"If the chimera is the first step down a dark path, the manticore is a door that can't be closed once it's been opened. A lion, a scorpion, the wings of a drake. All difficult to obtain but not impossible and just animals, anyway. The last component, the hissing hateful face of the beast, is the ingredient that makes a manticore so cruel. Young or old, man or woman, it matters not but that they are human, living and breathing, married to the creature with twisted magic. All sense of who they are is lost, and maybe that's a blessing, but the beast is born from human suffering. No wonder, then, that they're all so eager to kill.",16,3,d10+1 piercing 1,Stinger (Close Reach Messy),Wings ,"Solitary, Large, Construct",633,8,7.5,Green,

152,Twisted Experiment,Pegasus,"Don't go thinking that every creature not natural-born is a horrible abomination. Don't imagine for a second that they're all tentacles and screaming and blood or whatever. Take this noble beast, for example. Lovely thing, isn't it? A fine white horse with the wings of a swan. Don't look like it ought to be able to fly, but it does. The elves work miracles, in their own way. They breed true-that's the purity of elf-magic at work. Hatching from little crystal eggs and bonded with their riders for life. There's still some beauty in the world, mark my words.",10,1,d8,Sharp Hooves (Close),Wings ,"Group, Construct",561,9,8.5,Green,
153,Twisted Experiment,Rust Monster,"A very distinctive-looking creature. Something like a reddish cricket, I think. Long crickety legs, anyhow. Blind, too, as I understand it-they feel their way around with those long moth-looking tendrils. Feed that way, too. Sift through piles of metal for the choicest bits. That's what they eat, don't matter the type, neither. Their merest touch turns it all to rusted flakes. Magic lasts longer but under the scrutiny of a rust monster, it's a foregone conclusion. Only the gods know where they came from, but they're a curse if you value your belongings.",6,3,d8 ignores armor,Corrosive Touch (Close),Corrosive touch ,"Group, Construct",559,9,8.5,Green,
154,Twisted Experiment,Xorn,"Dwarf-made elemental garbage muncher. Shaped like a trash bin with a radius of arms to feed excess rock and stone into its gaping maw. They eat stone and excrete light and heat. Perfect for operating a mine or digging out a quarry. Once one gets lost in the sewers below a city, though, or in the foundation of a castle? You're in deep trouble. They'll eat and eat until you've got nothing left but to collapse the place down on it and move somewhere else. Ask Burrin, Son of Fjornnvald, exile from his clan. I bet he could tell you a story about a xorn.",12,2,d10,Maw (Close Reach),Burrowing ,"Solitary, Large, Construct",554,9,8.5,Green,
